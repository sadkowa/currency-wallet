# Kanban Tool

[Click to find out how it works!](https://sadkowa.github.io/KanbanTool/)

This task involved implementing a Kanban system based on the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) concept.

Basic elements:

- A board with defined columns and task limits
- Tasks with information such as:
    - Task name
    - Current column
    - User (person responsible)
- Ability to move tasks between columns
- A form (with validation) that allows adding new tasks to the board

---

### Solutions

In this project, I used:

- LocalStorage - to save information about tasks:
    - Moving a task to another column
    - Deleting a task
    - Adding a task
- Hooks:
    - useState
    - useContext
    - useStorage (Custom Hook - provides methods for storing and retrieving data from localStorage)
- Context Api - passing data within the application

When the task limit in a specific column is reached, a pop-up window with information about exceeding the limit appears.
